** Random choice from table

Use ~lume.randomchoice~ to make a random choice from a table.

** Iterating table

#+begin_src fennel
  ;; Iterate a sequential table.
  (each [_ x (ipairs [1 2 3])]
    (print x))
  ;; Iterate a general table.
  (each [key value (pairs {"key1" 52 "key2" 99})]
    (print key value))
#+end_src

** Printing the time passed to the screen

#+begin_src fennel
  (love.graphics.print
   (string.format "How many seconds have passed: %.1f." (love.timer.getTime))))
#+end_src


** TODO Setting unused modules to false is encouraged when you release your game.

Do this in ~conf.lua~

Note that you can't disable ~love.filesystem~ and ~love.data~; it's mandatory. The same goes for the ~love~ module itself. ~love.graphics~ needs ~love.window~ to be enabled.
