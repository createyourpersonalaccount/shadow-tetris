* Shadow Tetris

** TODO Make the pile that grows

** TODO Make key bindings configurable

This will require to use something of the form

#+begin_src fennel
{ {:quit-game
   ["Quit the game."
   [:q :escape]
   (lambda [k] (love.event.quit 0))]}
  {:move
   ["Move the shadow block."
   [:down :left :right :a :s :d]
   (lambda [k] (set last-key k))]}
}
#+end_src

** TODO Setting unused modules to false is encouraged when you release your game.

Do this in ~conf.lua~

Note that you can't disable ~love.filesystem~ and ~love.data~; it's mandatory. The same goes for the ~love~ module itself. ~love.graphics~ needs ~love.window~ to be enabled.
